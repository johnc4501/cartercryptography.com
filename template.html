		<h1>"Build your Own Custom Cipher" Template</h1>
		
		<main>
		<p>
		Description: 
		<br>
		<br>
		Read through the entire code in order to understand what is occuring logic wise. With that said this is a simple template that will allow you to create a shift cipher that works based on any formula that produces an integer.
		You get to decide what formula the plaintext will be shifted by. The shift is limited in that its alphabetical characters can only be shifted a max of 26 times until further shifting wraps around the alphabet and back to
		the start. This means that a shift of 27 is equivalent to a shift of 1, similary to the Caesar cipher. This custom cipher template is not meant to create a complex encryption process but rather to give a simple to understand
		and customizable mathematical shift that can be decided by any formula the user decides. 
		<br>
		<br>
		This line of code is the only code you will need to change in the template: custom_Shift_Formula = round()
		<br>
		<br>
		To create your own shift cipher with this template all you have to do is insert a formula into the parenthesis of round() in the
		custom_Shift_Formula variable. The round is needed to ensure that the formula always produces a whole number so do not remove it. Have Fun creating a shift cipher.
