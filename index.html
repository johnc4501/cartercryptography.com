			PLASE READ FIRST: Currently the GUI will open and take user input but the button is inoperable, however you can still use the Python Encryption Toolset by opening the cipher function files in Python, or a 
			Python editor such as PyCharm. This will be demonstrated and explained on each cipher webpage. 
			Please follow the instructions on each webpage to proceed. The Python Encryption GUIs are also downloadable, but if you would like to see the ciphers in action,
			follow the instructions given on each cipher webpage.
			<br>
			<br>
			Welcome to my Webiste. This purpose of this webiste is to give access to my Encryption Cipher Toolset and to educate on how each cipher works and what they do. 
			The Encryption Cipher Toolset is a set of Graphical User Interfaces created with Python and the Python Add-on Tkinter and include interactable encryption ciphers that accept 
			a user's Plaintext input and outputs encrpyted ciphertext. The user creates their own key for each cipher.
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>
			Before you can use the Encryption Cipher Tools you will need the following
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>The newest version of Python if you'd like to open the files via the Python command line. OR</li>
			<li>A Python Editor such as PyCharm if you'd like an easy way to open and run the files. The instructions for each Cipher will use this method.</li> 
			<li>Download the two zip files listed below and unzip them.</li>
			<li><a href="/Python_Imported/functions.zip" download>Click to Download All Cipher GUIs Python files (*Buttons Do not Work*)</a></li>
			<li><a href="/Python_Imported/gui.zip" download>Click to Download All Cipher Function Python files</a></li>
		</ul>
		<br>
		<p>
			The Ciphers that you will be able to work with through this webiste are: 
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="simple.html">The Simple Substitution Cipher</a></li>
			<li><a href="transposition.html">The Transposition Cipher</a></li>
			<li><a href="caesar.html">The Caesar Cipher</a></li>
			<li><a href="vertical.html">The Vertical Cipher</a></li>
			<li><a href="autokey.html">The Autokey Cipher</a></li>
			<li><a href="letter_number.html">The Letter-Number Cipher</a></li>
			<li><a href="reverse.html">The Reverse Cipher</a></li>
		</ul>
		<br>
		<p> 
			In addition to these ciphers, this webiste includes a template created in Python for a user to create their own Mathematical Equation-based cipher. 
			An example created with the template is also provided. Links to these webpages are included below.
